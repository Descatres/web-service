# Why [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)

CoinGecko keeps track of over 2 million cryptocurrencies ([according to their website](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api#:~:text=Historical%20data-,2M%2B,Coins,-100%2B)) and provides data for coins, NFTs, exchanges, exchange rates, etc. I chose to only "play" with coins (namely, cryptocurrencies) but creating webservices for the other APIs is as simple as done for the coins. For these, I chose to [TODO]. For the purpose of this assignment, this API provides enough data to explore via API calls and apply filters, sorting, and other operations to get the desired data.

CoinGecko API is free to use and does not require an API key, making it very suitable, in my opinion, for this project (this way I don't have to bother with unwanted complexity and focus just on the objective of the assignment).
Although, there is a rate limit of ~30 calls per minute, which is more than enough for this project ([source](<https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/common-errors-rate-limit#:~:text=For%20Public%20API%20user%20(Demo%20plan)%2C%20the%20rate%20limit%20is%20~30%20calls%20per%20minutes%20and%20it%20varies%20depending%20on%20the%20traffic%20size.>)).
