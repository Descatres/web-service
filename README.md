# web-service

Assignment 1 - DW course

Todo:

-   Acabar Explanation.md
-   Acabar README
-   Meter mais fucionabilidades no server
-   Verificar o jsconfig.json
-   verificar a cena do HTML/JSON ("provide responses in HTML and JSON")

-   The frontend is not ideal as it is but, since that is not the objective of this assignment, I kept it simple to save time and applied some filters to swap directly on the page instead of changing the link manually.
